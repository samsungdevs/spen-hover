This example shows how to detect S Pen hover gestures, on any Android View.
Devices such as Samsung Galaxy S4 and Note 3 have Air View, which means hover events can be triggered by bringing the finger close to the item. TO respond to Air View, hovering, please inclusion of intent-filter in Manifest.xml
